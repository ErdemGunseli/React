/* React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
It is used to build single page applications (SPAs).
To get started with React, first go to the directory in which you want to create the app.
Then run the following command:
  npx create-react-app <app-name>

The following files are created:
  package.json: contains the dependencies of the project
  package-lock.json: contains the exact version of the dependencies
  node_modules: contains the actual code for dependencies
  public: contains the static files
  src: contains the source code
  README.md: contains the information about the app

Inside the src folder, the following files are created:
  App.js: contains the main code of the app - add your components here and use them in the 'App' function
  App.css: contains the styling of the app
  index.js: contains the code to render the app
  index.css: contains the styling of the app
  logo.svg: contains the logo of React
  reportWebVitals.js: contains the code to report the performance of the app
  setupTests.js: contains the code to set up the tests for the app
  App.test.js: contains the code to test the app

To run the app, navigate to the app directory and run the following command:
  npm start

This may be useful when we want to add an element to an array, or add a property to an object.

/* 10 CORE REACT HOOKS IN-DEPTH EXPLANATION & EXAMPLES:

EACH HOOK NEEDS TO BE IMPORTED BEFORE BEING USED:
import { useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useRef, useMemo, 
  useCallback, useImperativeHandle, useLayoutEffect, useDebugValue } from 'react';


BASIC HOOKS:
  1) useState:
    Allows functional components to have state (similar to class-based components). 
    Returns an array with 2 elements, the variable which stores the state, 
    and a function that can be used to update the state (since the state is immutable).
*/

function StatefulComponent3() {
  /* It is fine to declare the state as a constant since it is immutable, 
  cannot be changed directly, only through the setter.
  The argument of the hook is the initial value of the state.
  Using destructuring allows the syntax to be very clean, 
  allowing the variable and setter to be given custom identifiers in one line.  

  So here, creating an attribute for the component with the initial value of 0:
  */
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // If we do not need to update the state, we can omit the setter:
  // const [someStaticState] = useState(0);

    <>

      <button onClick={() => {setCount(count + 1);}}>{count}</button>

      {/* Also returning the component for demonstrating the useEffect hook: */}
      <LifecycleComponent2 count={count}/>
    </>
  );
}



/*
  2) useEffect: allows functional components to have lifecycle methods.
    Calls the input callback function when the variables in the input dependencies array change:
      1. componentDidMount: If the array is empty, the callback function will only run after instantiation.
      2. componentDidUpdate: If the array is not empty, the callback function will run after instantiation and after every update.
      3. componentWillUnmount: If the callback function returns another function, the returned function will run when the component is unmounted.
      4. If no array is provided, the callback function will run after instantiation and whenever any state variable changes.
*/
function LifecycleComponent2({ count }) {

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("The component has just been initalised.")

useEffect(() => {
  console.log(`The component has just been updated. Count: ${count}`)

  return () => {console.log("The component has just been removed from the Document Object Model")}
}, [count]);


return null;
};



/*
  3) useContext: allows functional components to use context variables - variables that can be accessed by all child components.
    The createContext function is used to create a context variable and set its default value.
    The useContext hook is used to access the context variable, but the children components must be wrapped in 
    Context.Provider tags with the context value specified.
*/

  // Declaring the state for the context that we want to provide to the children:

  // Consuming the context value - this could be done even if this was a grandchild to the ContextComponent.
  const count = useContext(CountContext2)

  return (
    <p>Count: {count}</p>
  );
}



/*
  4) useReducer: for managing more complex state logic. It is particularly useful when the next state depends on the current state. 
  It requires an initial state and a reducer function (that should have state and action parameters) that changes the state depending on different actions, 
  and returns the new state. These are passed to the hook as arguments, and the hook returns the state of the variable, 
  and a dispatch function that is used to call the reducer function with different actions.

    <button onClick={() => dispatch({type: "DECREMENT"})} >Decrement</button>
    <button onClick={() => dispatch({type: "RESET"})} >Reset</button>
  </div>)
}


/*
  5) useRef: used for holding information that is not necessary for rendering, such as an element from the DOM or
  Unlike the useState hook, the useRef hook does not cause a re-render when the value changes.
*/

function RefComponent() {
  const buttonRef = useRef(null);

  function clickTheButton() {
    buttonRef.current.click();
  }

  return (
    <button ref={buttonRef}>Click Me!</button>
  );
}



/*
  6) useMemo: used for optimising expensive calculations by memorising the result of the calculation. 
  It caches the result of a function and only re-computes that result when specific values change.
  It takes the function that computes the value as well as an array of dependencies, returning a memorised value. 
  The array of dependencies is similar to useEffect.
*/

function MemoComponent() {
  const [inputNumber, setInputNumber] = useState(0);

  function factorial(number) {
    // This is the expensive calculation:
    if (number < 0) return "undefined";

    return number * factorial(number - 1);
  }

  // The factorial function will only be re-computed when the inputNumber changes:
  const memoisedFactorial = useMemo(() => factorial(inputNumber), [inputNumber]);

  return (<div>
    <p>The factorial of {inputNumber} is {memoisedFactorial}.</p>
    <input type="number"  onChange={(event) => setInputNumber(event.target.value)} />
  </div>);
}



/*
  7) useCallback: whilst useMemo is good for caching the result of a function, we may need to cache the function itself.
  When a function is defined inside of a component, a new function object is created every time the component is rendered.
  Wrapping the function in useCallback will return a memoised version of the function that only changes if one of the 
  dependencies has changed. It is particularly useful when passing callbacks to child components that require the same 
  function in the same memory location instead of a new function object that is actually a copy.
  It may seem that every function should use this hook, but the hook itself is expensive and should only be used when needed.
*/

function CallbackComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
