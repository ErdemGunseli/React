/* React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
It is used to build single page applications (SPAs).
To get started with React, first go to the directory in which you want to create the app.
Then run the following command:
  npx create-react-app <app-name>

The following files are created:
  package.json: contains the dependencies of the project
  package-lock.json: contains the exact version of the dependencies
  node_modules: contains the actual code for dependencies
  public: contains the static files
  src: contains the source code
  README.md: contains the information about the app

Inside the src folder, the following files are created:
  App.js: contains the main code of the app - add your components here and use them in the 'App' function
  App.css: contains the styling of the app
  index.js: contains the code to render the app
  index.css: contains the styling of the app
  logo.svg: contains the logo of React
  reportWebVitals.js: contains the code to report the performance of the app
  setupTests.js: contains the code to set up the tests for the app
  App.test.js: contains the code to test the app

To run the app, navigate to the app directory and run the following command:
  npm start

/* Each React function (can be declarations or expressions) corresponds to a UI component.
Components return JSX (JavaScript XML or JavaScript Syntax Extension) to describe the appearance of the UI.
JSX looks like HTML (uses tags), and can include JavaScript expressions within curly braces.
Having different components in different files is a common practice.
Component identifiers should start with a capital letter.

      If we want to show nothing, we can use the && operator:

/* In many situations, it is necessary to render a collection of values, such as the items in an array.
Loops can be used in these situations, but they cannot be embedded in JSX.

*/

      The key attribute of an HTML element helps React optimise the rendering on the list, 
      allowing an individual item to be re-rendered (instead of the whole array) if the value changes in the future. 
      However, DO NOT use the index of the array entry as a key. This will suppress the error provided by React,
      but won't allow React to properly optimise the performance. 
      

      {items.map(({ id, name }) => (<li key={id}>{name}</li>))}
      */}

      {/* When working with loops, the syntax will look neater if the loop is extracted into a separate component.

/* An event is a signal from the browser that an interaction has occurred, such as a mouse click or a key press.
In vanilla Javascript, we would likely grab a component from the DOM (Document Object Model 
a tree-like representation of the components within a web page) and add an event listener to it:
  const button = document.getElementById('button');
  button.addEventListener('click', (event) => console.log(event));

In React, we can add event callbacks directly to the JSX elements:
*/

// This is a React component that renders a button:
function Button() {

  // In most cases, it is beneficial to define the event handler outside of the JSX element:
  const handleClick = (event) => console.log(event);

  /* The onClick attribute takes a callback function as an argument (inside curly braces).
  The arrow syntax can be used pass the event object to the callback function.
  */
  return <button onClick={/*(event) => console.log(event)*/ (event) => handleClick(event)}>Click Me!</button>;

/* State is data that changes throughout the lifecycle of the application. We use props to share data between components,
but props are immutable, so we can't change their value and expect the UI to update. For data that changes, React provides
a hook called 'useState'. 

A hook is a function that can only be called at the top level of the component (i.e. cannot be called inside loops, conditions...)
and allows us to use state and other React features without utilising classes.
*/

    1) The current value of the state
    2) A function to update the state

  Destructuring allows us to extract the elements of the array into separate variables.
  So here, the count variable is set to 0, and the setCount function can be used to update the value of count.
  */
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  /* This component returns a paragraph with the current value of count, and a button that increases the count by 1.

  const [state, setState] = useState({ count: 0, theme: 'blue' });
  state = { ...state, count: state.count + 1 }; // count: 1, theme: 'blue'

This may be useful when we want to add an element to an array, or add a property to an object.

This is used for managing more complicated logic - similar to useState but gives more control over the state updates.

  Mounting: when the component is created and inserted into the DOM
  Updating: when the component is updated as a result of changes to props or state
  Unmounting: when the component is removed from the DOM

For class-based components, React provides lifecycle methods that we can override to run code at particular times in the lifecycle.
For functional components, we can use the 'useEffect' hook to run code at particular times in the lifecycle.

  which will run the callback function when the values in the array change.
  (Equal to componentDidUpdate in class-based components.)

  If the array is empty, the callback function will only run after mounting.
  (Equal to componentDidMount in class-based components.)

  Normally, there is no return value from the callback function, 
  but if we want to run some code when the component is unmounted,
  we can return an unmounting function from the callback function.

Without this, we would need to pass props down through many layers of components,

Context is especially useful when we have a global value that many components need to use.
